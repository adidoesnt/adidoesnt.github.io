title: About

Hi! My name is Aditya Banerjee, and I'm a software developer and fresh graduate
from the National University of Singapore. I specialise primarily in frontend
development, however I have experience with backend development and DevOps as
well. When I'm not coding or studying, I like to go for long runs and play music
with my band, Pencil Battery. I've played the drums since I was 3, although I
primarily sing and play the guitar now.
<br /><br />
I started my coding journey in high school, having taking Computer Science as
one of higher level subjects in IB. I grew fond of the subject very fast, and
eventually decided that it was the way forward for me. During my time in
National Service, I had a one year hiatus from coding which set me back a little
bit. However, upon entering university, I decided it was time to sharpen my
skills once again. The process wasn't quick, but my internships were definitely
a catalyst when it came to getting me back on track.
<br /><br />
My first internship was at Strive Education, where I worked primarily as a backend
developer. I was responsible for integrating and automating a large number of
business processes and systems, including but not limited to payment automation,
analytics, and quality control. As someone with very little experience at the
time, it was an incredible experience for me. I was able to sharpen my skills
with many tools and frameworks such as JavaScript, Google Apps Script, Python
and REST APIs.
<br /><br />
After my internship at Strive Education, I continued
my work with them as coding tutor for middle and high school students. Alongside
this, I strived to improve myself as a developer, picking up new skills such as
SQL, ReactJS and React Native. I also applied for the National University of
Singapore's flagship entrepreneurship program, NUS Overseas Colleges.
<br /><br />
NUS Overseas Colleges, or NOC allows students to work at a startup abroad,
while also pursuing entrepreneurship classes at a partner university in the same
location. I applied for the NOC program with Israel as my number one choice,
having read extensively about the birth and journey of the "startup nation". I
was thrilled to secure my spot in the program, however I still had to secure an
internship at a startup based in Israel.
<br /><br />
There were two startups that I was interested in working at in Israel: Cobwebs
Technologies and ByondXR. I was interested in Cobwebs Technologies due to my interest
in Open-source Intelligence and Cybersecurity. However, given that our NOC program was
set to be remote, the opportunity did not materialise. I was interested in ByondXR due
to the interesting nature of their work, however given my lack of exposure to
mixed reality technologies, I was unsure if I would be able to secure an
internship there.
<br /><br />
After two rounds of interviews, it seemed my lack
of project experience with a number of important technologies was going to cost
me my opportunity at ByondXR. At this point, I took it upon myself to implement
a self-initiated project called "Classmate". The project was a React application
to display NUS modules, and allow students to plan their semester by selecting
the modules they wanted to enrol in. The project was not officially affiliated
with NUS in any way, and though it was not a very complex project by any means,
it demonstrated moderate proficiency, and more importantly, a willingness to
learn new things. This in turn allowed me to secure an internship with ByondXR.
<br /><br />
ByondXR used mixed reality technology to create immersive e-commerce
experience for customers of many large brands. My job involved the creation of
plugins that added the interactive layer to 3D environments that serve as the
base for the e-commerce experiences or supported other plugins in doing so. My
time at ByondXR was extremely transformative for me, and played a large role in
making me the developer I am today. I exposed myself to a large number of tools and
frameworks such as TypeScript, React, Jest, NX, MongoDB, GraphQL and Docker.
More importantly, I received invaluable mentorship and training from my senior
developers.
<br /><br />
Outside of my internships, I also established and worked on a startup called
OURFinals with 3 of my university batch-mates. The idea behind OURFinals was to
provide ad-hoc on-demand peer tutoring for university students. We pursued this
idea for a while, creating a Telegram bot to link tutors and students as a
moderately successful MVP. However, as our clientele was university students, it
was difficult to find a pricing balance that satisfied both tutors and students,
because as we know all too well, university students are extremely short on two
very important things: money and time. As a result, my co-founder and I are
currently trying to pivot.
<br /><br />
I'm often described as a very outgoing and approachable friend and colleague. I pride
myself on my ability to adapt to and communicate in different environments. I'm always
willing to try and learn new things. I'd like to conclude by thanking you for taking
the time to read this, and I hope to connect with you soon!
